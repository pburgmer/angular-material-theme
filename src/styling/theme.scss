 * $assets-base-path as parameter with default value just to be able to override it for the demo.
 * No need to pass in $assets-base-path in regular installations.
 * Background: sass does not rewrite relative URLs. URLs will not be changed during compilation.
 * Therefore URLs are not relative to the file they are written in but relative to the output of the sass compiler.
 * In Angular context the CLI (webpack) will rewrite URLs and copy the assets of node modules. with ~ we can use a
 * quasi absolute path starting at our node_modules folder.
 * If the theme is not installed as a package, the user has to adjust the path (should be relevant for the demo only).
